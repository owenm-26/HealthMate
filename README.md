## Inspiration
As someone who values his health and has lofty long-term goals set, I have realized that making smaller sub-goals is the best way to get there. 

However, as an Software Engineer Intern, Teacher's Assistant, and full-time student, my usual regimine is frequently thrown out of sync. This app is one that I wish I had so that I don't need to rely on a fragile daily cadence to achieve the goals that I dearly want to achieve.
